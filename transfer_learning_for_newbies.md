# Transfer Learning For Newbies

## Introduction
I have created this repository with detailed explanation of code.  
I have documented carefully each and every step of this project. 

The basic steps of this project Involve
1.	Acquiring the data
2.	Preprocessing the data
3.	Labeling the data
4.	Building the model
5.	Training the model
6.	Predicting on the model

Everything is written in python . All the libraries are python libraries

Here goes detailed explanation of each step

Step 1 Acquiring the data
This is an binary classifier of Tom and Jerry. I have picked “Tom and Jerry” since its one of well known humorous cartoon  and best of my childhood memories.

I have acquired Images of Tom and Jerry from the Internet.
Technically speaking it's also called web Scraping. There are several techniques of web scraping in python , if you know javaScript there are various ways in which you can extract bulk Images from web pages with manipulation of JavaScript Code.

As for this project I have manually download all the Images and other formats of Media
The most forms of media I was able to acquire were
1.	Images - of formats 
2.	Gifs  - of formats
3.	Videos - of formats
4.	Web files - of formats

As for preprocessing is concerned, I have converted all the Input files as Image files of format .jpeg

There are separate python scripts for each conversion as given below
1.	Gifs to Images
2.	Videos to Images
3.	Web files to Images
4.	Other format Images to .jpeg format Images
